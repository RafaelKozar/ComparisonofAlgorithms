### Problem
Given \( n \) Cartesian points, the goal is to find the \( k \) points closest to the origin (axis 0). Each algorithm uses different approaches to balance the time spent sorting and inserting points. Hereâ€™s how they compare:

### Algorithms and Big O Notation

1. **First Algorithm**
   - **Steps**: Calculates distances for all \( n \) points, stores them in a list, sorts the list, and then returns the \( k \) closest points.
   - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \) for distance calculations + \( O(n \log n) \) for sorting + \( O(k) \) for selecting the \( k \) closest.
   - **Performance**: Average time is **500ms** for \( n = 1,000,000 \) and \( k = 10 \).
   
2. **Second Algorithm**
   - **Steps**: Calculates distances and inserts each point into a `SortedSet`, which keeps elements sorted during each insertion.
   - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \) for distance calculations + \( O(n \log n) \) for inserting into `SortedSet` + \( O(k) \) to retrieve the closest \( k \) points.
   - **Performance**: Average time is **1500ms** for \( n = 1,000,000 \) and \( k = 10 \).
   - **Analysis**: Inserting each element into a `SortedSet` is computationally expensive because it requires maintaining order at each insertion, which becomes costly with large \( n \).
   
3. **Third Algorithm (Optimized)**
   - **Steps**: Same as the second, but restricts the `SortedSet` to contain only \( k \) elements at a time. This keeps the set small, reducing the processing needed for insertion.
   - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \) for distance calculations + \( O(n \log k) \) for maintaining the sorted set with \( k \) elements + \( O(k) \) for retrieving the points.
   - **Performance**: Average time is **300ms** for \( n = 1,000,000 \) and \( k = 10 \).
   - **Analysis**: Restricting the `SortedSet` to \( k \) elements means fewer operations during each insertion, improving performance significantly for large \( n \) while maintaining the order of the \( k \) closest points.

### Summary of Results

| Algorithm | Big O Complexity                | Average Time (ms) |
|-----------|---------------------------------|--------------------|
| First     | \( O(n) + O(n \log n) + O(k) \) | 500               |
| Second    | \( O(n) + O(n \log n) + O(k) \) | 1500              |
| Third     | \( O(n) + O(n \log k) + O(k) \) | 300               |

### Conclusion

The **third algorithm** is the most efficient. By limiting the `SortedSet` to \( k \) elements, it minimizes the time complexity and yields the fastest performance, especially effective when \( n \) is very large and \( k \) is small.
